Question 1
What is the first thing you should do when an interviewer asks you a technical question?
    Repeat the question back to the interviewer in your own words. This ensures you'll both be in agreement on the problem to be solved.

Question 2
A technical interview evaluates a candidate’s _______?
    Ability to write code. Technical interviews focus on the programming responsibilities of the position.

Question 3
If writing a function that removed duplicates from a list of values, ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] would be a good test input.
    False. Choose an input which contains duplicate values to illustrate how they are removed with the function.

Question 4
In a whiteboarding interview, the candidate will have access to a text editor to check the syntax of their code.
    False. The interviewee must rely on their ability to write code and express ideas by hand.

Question 5
When considering inputs for your function, what are edge cases?
    Inputs which could cause issues with the implementation of your code.
    An edge case can be an invalid input, or inputs which cause your code to execute in a way you had not expected.

Question 6
What two steps follow writing solution code on the whiteboard?
    Test the implementation and analyze the time and space complexity.
    These steps ensure the solution is correct and efficient.

Question 7
While writing the solution on a whiteboard, it’s best to write in silence and ignore the interviewer.
    False. You should communicate with the interviewer during the entire interview.

Question 8
What is the next step after clarifying the technical question asked by the interviewer?
    Create example inputs and outputs to the function you will write.
    Sample inputs help guide a solution by defining exactly what the function will do.
