BINARY SEARCH TREES: JAVASCRIPT
Review
In this lesson, you have successfully built a binary tree data structure in JavaScript. You have implemented:

a BinaryTree class containing value, left and right child nodes and a depth
an .insert() method to add and place a value at the correct location in the binary tree
a .getNodeByValue() method to retrieve a child node by its value or null
a .depthFirstTraversal() method to traverse the binary tree using the inorder traversal option
Congratulations!

1.
Open up script.js and run it. This script generates ten random numbers to be added to an existing binary tree with an initial value of 15. Study the output generated on the terminal and try to graph the binary tree on your own.
