BINARY SEARCH: JAVASCRIPT
Checking the Middle Index
Letâ€™s consider how to implement an approach to check whether the value at indexToCheck is equal to the target value. Below, we use pseudocode to display two additional steps that will check if the target value is found.

function binarySearch (arr, target)
  left = 0
  right = length of arr

  indexToCheck = the floor integer of (left + right) / 2
    
  checking = value of arr at indexToCheck

  if checking is the target
    return indexToCheck
In the example above, we set a variable called checking to the value in arr at the position indexToCheck. Then, we return the index if it is equal to the target value.

2.
Create an if statement that returns indexToCheck if checking is equal to target. If your solution is implemented correctly, the script should log 5 to the console.
