MinHeap Class
MinHeap Class
Our MinHeap class will store two pieces of information:

An array of elements within the heap.
A count of the elements within the heap.
To make our lives easier, weâ€™ll always keep one element at the beginning of the array with the value null. By doing this, we can simplify our coding by always referencing our minimum element at index 1 instead of 0 and our last element at index this.size instead of this.size - 1.

const minHeap = new MinHeap();
console.log(minHeap.heap);
// [ null ]
console.log(minHeap.size);
// 0

Instructions
Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.

define a size property instantiated to 0.
Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
In script.js, make an instance of MinHeap and assign it to the const variable minHeap.

Checkpoint 3 Passed
3.
In script.js, display the heap content of minHeap.
